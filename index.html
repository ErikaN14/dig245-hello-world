        Why This Course?
        
    </h2>

    <body>
            I chose this course in order to learn more about web design and the work involved in creating a website. 
            I also am interested in pursuing a career in web and app design post Davidson and I felt like this course 
            would be a good way to begin building a portfolio to show once I am applying for jobs.

        What Experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?
    </h2>

    <body>
        I have taken various Computer science courses at Davidson where different languages from Java to Python were covered.
        One class that I did take where I designed a website was the Data Visualization course. I worked with another student 
        to create a website that discussed the disparities seen within the Computer Science field in relation to gender.
