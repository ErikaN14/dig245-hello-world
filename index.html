    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <h2>Name: Erika Navarro</h2> </li>
        <li> <h2>Year: Senior (Class of 2024)</h2> </li>
        <li>  <h2>Major: Computer Science Major</h2> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Course?</h2>

    <p>
      I chose this course in order to learn more about web design and the work
      involved in creating a website. I also am interested in pursuing a career
      in web and app design post Davidson and I felt like this course would be a
      good way to begin building a portfolio to show once I am applying for
      jobs.

    <h2>
      What Experience Do You Have Creating Content for the Web or with Programming?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have taken various Computer science courses at Davidson where different
      languages from Java to Python were covered. One class that I did take
      where I designed a website was the Data Visualization course. I worked
      with another student to create a website that discussed the disparities
      seen within the Computer Science field in relation to gender. I also took
      part in a summer program in high school where the final project was to
      create a website using the different lessons we learned that related to
      HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    </p>

    <h2>What are My Goals for this Course?</h2>

    <p>
        My goals for this course are to learn how to create a basic website and
        apply the knowledge from this class to create a portfolio of all the
        websites that we work on throughout the semester as well as websites that
        I worked on independently.

    <h2>Tutorial:  <a href="https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/data-types.md"
        >Data Types</a
      ></h2>

    <p>
      The tutorial that I completed focused on the different data types that
      exist. The tutorial starts by discussing these different data types and
      splitting them into two groups, primitive and objects. The tutorial
      includes one section that gives examples of the different primitive types
      and objects being discussed. With each example,there are also practice
      activities that allow you to see the output of each using the console.
      There is also part of the tutorial that focuses on the 'typeof' command
      which is useful when identifying what data type you are working with.
      Finally, the tutorial goes into detail on two data exchange formats,
      Tabular Data and Hierarchical Data. I thought that the various examples
      included for each of these gave me a better understanding of the
      differences between the two. After completing this tutorial, I feel like I
      have a better understanding of what different data types there are.

    <h2>Web-Based Projects</h2>

      <a href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/"
        >Facebook Demetricator</a
      ></h3>

      <p>
        Facebook Demetricator is a website that allows users to use the facebook
        system without having all the statistics involved like number of
        followers, likes, and other information. Social media is something that
        we all use in our everyday lives but these statistics impact our own
        lives and how we feel towards ourselves. Getting rid of these statistics
        allows users to focus on building connections with the people they
        follow rather than focus on who is liking their posts and how many
        followers they have.

        <h3><li><b>Project #2:</b></li>
      <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a></h3>
      <p>
        The Noun Project is a website that provides icons and images that can be
        used for all types of presentations. It offers a wide variety of images
        for any topic that you could think of. I like this website because it
        makes it easy to add visual aspects to any presentation in order to make
        It looks nice but also to make your presentation accessible.

        <h3><li><b>Project #3:</b> <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a></li></h3>
      <p>
        Freedom is a website that allows you to focus on the work that you are
        doing by blocking all digital distractions seen online as well as by
        managing your screen time. I know I at times find myself distracted by
        things like netflix or other online apps when I should be focusing on
        the task that I am working on. This website will change the way that we
        go about our daily routines by allowing us to focus on what we have to
        do rather finding ourselves in an endless cycle of online distractions.

    <!-- Overall the assignment was not difficult to follow especially after completing the
    readings. At times i found myself overwhelmed when trying to maintain an organized structure
    within my code but the Prettier extension helped with this concern.-->
